---Repository for a socialevent detection---
Project made by students from the UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya).
All files are performed for PYTHON language, you can compile it without problems, you only have to change all the path that appear
in the scripts, following same folding's organitzation.
This files are tools created by PYXEL library that allow to classify images in differents predefined classes by two ways: using the
metadata asociated to the images or analising the images features.

The result of the classification determines the event between 9 classes (concert, conference, 
exhibition, fashion, other, protest, sports, theater_dance and no_event).

Then, there are instructions to do the classification using this tools.

If you want to do classification via metadata (textual) you have to create in your workspace a folder named: 1_images, and inside
create two folders more: test and train (when we copy all photografies for train and test our classificator.
Then you've to run seqüentially:
    - 2_Database -> create two files (test.txt and train.txt) with all images ID's that belong to the images in each folder.
    - 4_tfidf -> to create the vocabulary (word) and create for each image (in train and test) a BoW (bag of words).
    - 5_annotation -> to create ontology and anotation, only one time for all runnings.
    - 5_models -> train the trainer, and as a result, create class models to do the image's detection.
    - 6_Detection -> do automatic detection of image class.

If you want to do classification via visual analisis you have to create in your workspace a folder named: 1_images, and inside
create two folders more: test and train (when we copy all photografies for train and test our classificator.
Then you've to run seqüentially:
    - 2_Database -> create two files (test.txt and train.txt) with all images ID's that belong to the images in each folder.
    - 3_vocabulary -> to create the vocabulary.
    - 4_bof -> create a BoF (bag of features) for each image.
    - 5_annotation -> to create ontology and anotation, only one time for all runnings.
    - 5_models -> train the trainer, and as a result, create class models to do the image's detection.
    - 6_Detection -> do automatic detection of image class.
    *Pay attention to comment lines and be sure to consider the visual option in the common scripts.
